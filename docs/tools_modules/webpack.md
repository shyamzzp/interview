# Webpack

## Introduction

Webpack is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. It bundles modules with dependencies into a single file.
Webpack is a free and open-source module bundler for JavaScript. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
