### Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

```java
The idea behind solving the problem is very simple, we need to keep track of the characters we have seen so far and the length of the substring.

The same can be achieved with usage of Set and a pointer to keep track of the start of the substring, and along with that we can use sliding window method to check the current length of the longest substring.

### Median of two Sorted Arrays

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

```java
Main idea behind finding the median for a 1D array is that you keep on removing the min and the max element from the array until you are either left with 1 or two elements in the array. You can apply the same concept here with using four pointers to keep track of the start end for both the sorted array.

```java
The DP approach to this question is quite simple actually! For any given substring, we can confirm if it is a palindrome in O(1) time if:

The characters at the ends of the substring are the same.
If the inner substring is a palindrome.
Which will be represented by dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] && s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j). So the dp matrix you can imagine will look like all the true value in the diagonal center as it denotes the palindrome of a single character and all the down cells to this diagonal will be false because they represent the particular length in reverse order which we don't want.

Like wise we will be calculating the values for the top of diagonal section of the matrix. And there for every cell we would need the left-down diagonal value to be calculated first which is represented by dp[i+1][j-1].

### Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2);
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7] Output: 49

```java
The idea is to maximize the distance between the two bars and for that we can take two pointers start and end. We will calculate the area by taking the minimum of the two heights and multiply it with the difference between the two pointers. 

And for moving the pointers we will check wether the value at the start is less or higher that the value at the end index.

### Rotate Image

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

```java
public void rotate(int[][] matrix);
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

</div>
<div class="top100-liked-leetcode-item">

```java
If you know some about Math, then we know that the Rotation is actually a process which is combination of Transpose and Reverse the Matrix. So Transposing means we swap the value diagonally and Reverse the matrix means we reverse the rows assuming each row as 1D Matrix.

### Jump Game II

Given an array of non-negative integers nums, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

```java
public int jump(int[] A);
```

<span class="tag-is-success">Array</span>
<span class="tag-is-success">Greedy</span>

![Solution BorderRadius8 MarginTop10](_img/top100-liked-leetcode/2022-06-23-18-51-59.png)

</div>
<div class="top100-liked-leetcode-item">

```java
One quick solution for the problem is that stand at the end position and check if you can reach the current position from left, meaning Find the leftmost position that can reach the current position.

public int jump(int[] nums) {
    int position = nums.length - 1;
    int steps = 0;
    while (position != 0) {
        for (int i = 0; i < position; i++) {
            if (nums[i] >= position - i) {
                position = i;
                steps++;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return steps;
}
TC: O(n) But for the worst case we can have a O(n^2).
To avoid that we can add an extra check at the start like below.

if len(set(nums)) < 2:
    return math.ceil((len(nums)-1)/(nums[0])) if nums and nums[0] else 0

SC: O(1) but will take O(n) if we are checking for the second part.

### Longest Valid Parentheses

Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

```java
public int longestValidParentheses(String s);
Input: s = "(()" Output: 2
```

<span class="tag-is-success">Dynamic Programming</span>
<span class="tag-is-success">String</span>
<span class="tag-is-success">Stack</span>

</div>
<div class="top100-liked-leetcode-item">

```java
The idea is to traverse the string from left to right and keep track of the number of opening and closing parentheses. If open==close then we know that this is the valid sequence and if they are not equal then we reinitialize the count of both open and close to 0. Likewise repeat the process by iterating the string from right to left.

```

  <summary>Solution - Twice Iteration</summary>
  <div>

```java showLineNumbers
class Solution {
    public int longestValidParentheses(String s) {
        int max=0;
        int open = 0, close=0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
            if(s.charAt(i) == '(') open++;
            else close++;
            if(open == close){
                max = Math.max(max, open*2);
            }else if(close>open){
                open = close = 0;
            }
        }
        
        open = close=0;
        for(int i=s.length()-1;i>=0;i--){
            if(s.charAt(i) == '(') open++;
            else close++;
            if(open == close){
                max = Math.max(max, open*2);
            }else if(close<open){
                open = close = 0;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
TC: O(n)
SC: O(1)

```java
Using stack also we can solve the problem. We keep track of checking whether the string scanned so far is a valid one and also the length of the longest valid string. In order to do so, we start by pushing -1 onto the stack. For every '(' encountered, we push its index onto the stack.
For every ')' encountered, we pop the topmost element. Then, the length of the currently encountered valid string of parentheses will be the difference between the current element's index and the top element of the stack.

```

<details>
  <summary>Solution - Stack</summary>
  <div>

```java showLineNumbers
class Solution {
    public int longestValidParentheses(String s) {
        int max=0;
        int open = 0, close=0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
            if(s.charAt(i) == '(') open++;
            else close++;
            if(open == close){
                max = Math.max(max, open*2);
            }else if(close>open){
                open = close = 0;
            }
        }
        
        open = close=0;
        for(int i=s.length()-1;i>=0;i--){
            if(s.charAt(i) == '(') open++;
            else close++;
            if(open == close){
                max = Math.max(max, open*2);
            }else if(close<open){
                open = close = 0;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
TC: O(n)
SC: O(n) As we are using Stack for the storage.
